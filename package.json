  "description": "Today we will be creating a user profiles page that tracks the current user on the back-end and displays information specific to that user. This app will serve\r all of our front end files, preventing the need for `live-server` or `http-server`. By the end of the project you will be comfortable using express sessions,\r hiding application secrets, and serving static files from the back-end.",
